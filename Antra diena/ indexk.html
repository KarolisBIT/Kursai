    Bayerische Motoren Werke AG, commonly referred to as BMW (German pronunciation: [ˌbeːʔɛmˈveː] (audio speaker
    iconlisten)), is a German multinational corporate manufacturer of luxury vehicles and motorcycles headquartered
    in
    Munich, Bavaria, Germany. The corporation was founded in 1916 as a manufacturer of aircraft engines, which it
    produced from 1917 until 1918 and again from 1933 to 1945.

    Automobiles are marketed under the brands BMW, Mini and Rolls-Royce, and motorcycles are marketed under the
    brand
    BMW Motorrad. In 2017, BMW was the world's fourteenth-largest producer of motor vehicles, with 2,279,503
    vehicles
    produced.[3] The company has significant motorsport history, especially in touring cars, Formula 1, sports cars
    and
    the Isle of Man TT.

    BMW is headquartered in Munich and produces motor vehicles in Germany, Brazil, China, India, Mexico, the
    Netherlands, South Africa, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The Quandt family is a long-term
    shareholder
    of the company (with the remaining shares owned by public float), following brothers Herbert and Harald Quandt's
    investments in 1959 which saved the company from bankruptcy.
